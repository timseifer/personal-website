        I was trying to figure out what to put in the about page and I thought a daily blog would be fun and interesting! Before that
        begins I thought I may as well explain what I've done over this summer. At the beginning of the summer I signed up for a java
        programming class where I learned java. In addition to learning Java I took up two personal projects, my own personal website 
        created through the react framework, and another personal website which can be found here: https://cass-glitch.github.io/cass-website/#/Parallaxe.
        I'm currently working on learning back-end coding as well with mongodb and postman. I'm currently working on a stock tracker, that will
        use an api.

        Entry #1 8/27/2020
        I'm two days away from going back to tufts and as it draws closer I'm getting a little scared. I'm meeting
        new people in this cohort, there's testing I have to do with covid, and I also have to move all my stuff back in.
        This stuff is always a little nerve wracking, but once monday arrives I'll have eight days before classes begin. I'm 
        beginning my internship search as well and I'm trying to find a good method of applying. This semester I'm also hoping
        to get more involved in clubs and meet more people, the problem is alot of these clubs are really competitive but hopefully
        I'll find something.
