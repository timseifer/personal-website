    Hello my name is Tim Seifert and I'm a student at Tufts University. 
    I grew up in the small Appalachia town of Hagerstown, Maryland. With the Appalachian Mountains and farm fields in my backyard,I grew up in a community which allowed me to gain a deep appreciation for the outdoors. I joined the Boy Scouts of America,where I learned how to lead with humility. I ultimately earned the Eagle Scout rank. In high school, I started learning Python as a hobby. My interest in computer science started here, and eventually allowed me to model the phenomena of electron excitationand photon emission for a chemistry project. I successfully completed the International Baccalaureatte (IB) Diploma program,and graduated as valedictorian with both the state and IB diplomas. These experiences brought me to Tufts University, where Iâ€™mcurrently majoring in Computer Science and minor in Cognitive Brain Science.

At Tufts the first language taught is C++. Here a strong foundation in fundamental programming skills is honed in with project based learning. 
These projects can be accessed on my github page and a few of my own personal projects can be found on my hobby code page. HTML javascript react and CSS were all
used in the development of this website. Besides just enjoying to write use these languages for fun, in the summer 2020 I took a formal java programming class.
