    Hello my name is Tim Seifert and I'm a student at Tufts University. 
    I grew up in the small Appalachia town of Hagerstown, Maryland. With the Appalachian Mountains and farm fields in my backyard,I grew up in a community which allowed me to gain a deep appreciation for the outdoors. I joined the Boy Scouts of America,where I learned how to lead with humility. I ultimately earned the Eagle Scout rank. In high school, I started learning Python as a hobby. My interest in computer science started here, and eventually allowed me to model the phenomena of electron excitationand photon emission for a chemistry project. I successfully completed the International Baccalaureatte (IB) Diploma program,and graduated as valedictorian with both the state and IB diplomas. These experiences brought me to Tufts University, where Iâ€™mcurrently majoring in Computer Science and minor in Cognitive Brain Science.
